# Think like a designer (part 3) - Aesthetics
In data visualizatino, and communicating with data in general - spending time to make our designs aesthetically pleasing can mean our audience will have more patience with our visuals. 
1. Be smart with colour - The use of colour should always be an intentional decision. Use colour sparingly and strategically to highlight the important parts of your visual.
2. Pay attention to alignment - Organize elements on the page to create clean vertical and horizontal lines to establish a sense of unity and cohesion.
3. Leverage white space - Preserve margins; don't stretch your graphics to fill the space, or add things simply because you have extra space.

Thoughtful use of colour, alignment, and white space are components of the design that you don't even notice when they are done well. But you notice when they aren't. Attention to aesthetics of your visual shows a general respect for your work and your audience. THis creates a sort of onus on the part of the audience to sepnd more time to understand your visual (this contract doesn't exist with poor design).
