# Clutter is your Enemy!

## Cognitive Load
- Every single element that you add to a blank page will take up some cognitive load on the audience.
- Every member of your audience has a finite amount of cognitive load (mental processing power) that they can take.
- There is also a perceived cognitive load: how hard they believe they are going to have to work to get the information out of your communication. If the perceived cognitive load is too high, you risk your audience deciding that they don't want to take the time and processsing power to understand what you're showing. Think about lectures and super cluttered slides.
- Identify anything that isn't adding enough informative value to make up for its presence - and remove those things. 

### 1. Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception
When it comes to identifying which elements in our visuals are signal (useful info), and which are noise (clutter), consider the 6 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception.

#### 1.1. Proximity
When we see objects that are physically close in proximity, we automatically assume that they belong to a specific grouping.

- Here, we see columns and rows, simply due to the dot spacing.

#### 1.2. Similarity
Objects of similar colour, shape, size, or orientation are perceived as belonging to a particular group.

- We can use this to help draw our audience's eyes in the direction we want them to focus on.

#### 1.3. Enclosure
Objects that are physically enclosed together suggest that they belong to a particular group.

- We can use this to draw visual distinctions within data.

#### 1.4. Closure

#### 1.5. Continuity

#### 1.6. Connection
