# Clutter is your Enemy!

## Cognitive Load
- Every single element that you add to a blank page will take up some cognitive load on the audience.
- Every member of your audience has a finite amount of cognitive load (mental processing power) that they can take.
- There is also a perceived cognitive load: how hard they believe they are going to have to work to get the information out of your communication. If the perceived cognitive load is too high, you risk your audience deciding that they don't want to take the time and processsing power to understand what you're showing. Think about lectures and super cluttered slides.
- Identify anything that isn't adding enough informative value to make up for its presence - and remove those things. 

## Who, what, and How
Consider, 
1. To **whom** are you communicating? (_Who is your audience and how do they perceive you?_)
2. **What** do you want your audience to know or do? (_How do you want your audience to act? What tone will you use?_)
3. **How** can you use data to help make your point?

### 1. Who
#### (is) Your audience 
- The more specific, the better. Avoid general audiences and identify the decision maker to narrow your audience.
- If you try to communicate to too many people with different needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you cannot communicate to anyone as effectively as you could if you narrowed your audience. This would result in creating many different commmunications for different audiences.
