# The Importance of Context

### Exploratory vs Explanatory analysis
Exploratory is for understanding the data and identifying interesting points to highlight to others. This may take many different hypotheses and approaches before you have found something noteworthy. Explanatory is the part when we need to communicate the exploratory analysis to the audience by having a specific story that you want to tell or explain.

Often, we mistakenly focus on showing the exploratory analysis as evidence of the work you did and the robustness of the analysis. Resist this urge and instead, concentrate on the information your audience needs to know. 

### Who what, and how
Consider, 
1. To **whom** are you communicating? (_Who is your audience and how do they perceive you?_)
2. **What** do you want your audience to know or do? (_How do you want your audience to act? What tone will you use?_)
3. **How** can you use data to help make your point?

### 1. Who
#### (is) Your audience 
- The more specific, the better (i.e. avoid general audiences such as "internal and external stakeholders" or "to whom it may concern")
- By trying to communicate to too many people with different needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you cannot communicate to anyone as effectively as you could if you narrowed your audience. This might mean you may need to create different communications for different audiences.
- Thus, identify the decision maker to narrow your audience. This will put you in a better position to formulate a communication that will resonate with them as well as ensure that your meet their needs and yours. 

#### (are) You
- What is your relationship with the audience and how will they perceive you?
- Is this the first time you are interacting with them through this communication?
- Do they already trust you as an expert? Or do you need to build up this trsut to establish credibility?

### 2. What
#### Action (will your analysis invoke)
- What do you need your audience to know or do? Consider how you will make your communicaiton relevant for your audience and form a clear understanding of why they should care about what you say. If you cannot clearly aritculate what it is your audience will gain from your analysis, then you should revisit the need to communicate in the first place.
- You are the SME in the data that you analyze, so you should help lead people to understanding and action. Be more confident when making specific observations and recommendations based on your analysis. Even if you are wrong, it will prompt the right conversations focused on action. And if it isn't appropriate to recommend an action, then ecnourage discussion towards one or suggest possible next steps.
- The moment you invoke action, your audience has to make a decision whether to comply or not as opposed to just saying "Oh, that's interesting" and then moving on to the next thing.

#### Mechanism (will you use to communicate) 
- The method you use to communicate (live presentation vs email) has implications on the amount of control you will have over how the audeince takes in the information, and the level of detail that needs to be explicit.
- In a LIVE presentation, you are in full control as you determine what the audience sees and when they see it. You can also respond to visual cues and go into a partiuclar point in more/less detail. Thus, not all of these details need to be in the slides as you are there to answer any questions come up.
- With a written document or email, you have less control as the audience can choose how they consume the information themselves. The level of detail needed here is typically higher as you aren't there to respond to your audience's cues. Thus, the document will need to addess more of the potential questions.
