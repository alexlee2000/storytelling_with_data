# The Importance of Context

## Exploratory vs Explanatory analysis
1. Exploratory: Understanding the data and identifying interesting points to highlight to others. (May require many iterations/hypothesis)
2. Explanatory: Communicating the exploratory analysis to the audience by having a specific story.

Often, we mistakenly focus on showing the exploratory analysis as evidence of the work you did and the robustness of the analysis. Resist this urge and instead, concentrate on the information that your audience needs to know. 

## Who, what, and How
Consider, 
1. To **whom** are you communicating? (_Who is your audience and how do they perceive you?_)
2. **What** do you want your audience to know or do? (_How do you want your audience to act? What tone will you use?_)
3. **How** can you use data to help make your point?

### 1. Who
#### (is) Your audience 
- The more specific, the better. Avoid general audiences and identify the decision maker to narrow your audience.
- If you try to communicate to too many people with different needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you cannot communicate to anyone as effectively as you could if you narrowed your audience. This would result in creating many different commmunications for different audiences.
  
#### (are) You
- What is your relationship with the audience and how will they perceive you?
- Is this the first time you are interacting with them through this communication?
- Do they already trust you as an expert? Or do you need to build up this trust to establish credibility?

### 2. What
#### Action (will your analysis invoke)
- What do you need your audience to know/do? What is the relevance to them? Why should they care about what you say? If you cannot clearly articulate what your audience will gain from your analysis, then revisit the need to communicate at all.
- You are the SME in the data that you analyze, so help lead people to understanding/action. Be confident when making specific observations and recommendations based on your analysis. If you are wrong, it will prompt the right conversations which will lead to action. If it isn't appropriate to recommend an action, then encourage discussion towards one or suggest possible next steps.

#### Mechanism (will you use to communicate) 
- The method you use to communicate (live presentation vs email) has implications on the amount of control you will have over how the audience takes in the information. The method will also determine the level of detail that needs to be explicit or removed. 
- In a LIVE presentation, you determine what the audience sees and when they see it. You can also respond to visual cues and go into a partiuclar point in more/less detail. Thus, not all of the specific details need to be in the slides.
- With a written document or email, the audience can choose how they consume the information themselves. Thus, the level of detail needed here is generally higher and the document will need to address more of the potential questions that may arise.

#### Tone (What tone do you want your communication to set?)
Consider are you: 
- celebrating a success?
- trying to light a fire to drive action?

Consider is the topic:
- Lighthearted?
- Serious?

### 3. How
Consider what data is available that will make my point?

##### Ignore the unsupporting data?
You might assume that showing only the data that backs up your point and ignoring the rest will make your story stronger. However, this is misleading and only painting a one-sided story which is very risky. Do not ignore the unsupporting data!
  
### Consulting for context: questions to ask
Often, communications are at the request of someone else: a client, stakeholder, or your boss. This means that you may not have all of the context needed and you might need to consult with the person requesting the communication to fully understand the situation. Here are some good prompts to help you ensure you have all the context you need...
- What background information is relevant or essential?
- Who is the decision maker? What do we know about them?
- What biases does the audience have?
- What data is available? Where are the risks?
- What would a successful outcome look like?

## Useful Concepts
Below are some concepts that may help to identify the single most important message: The 3 minute story & Big Idea

###  The 3-minute story
If you only have 3 minutes to tell your audience what they needed to know, what would you say? This will ensure that you have clarity in the story you want to tell and can articulate it well, removing your dependence on slides or visuals all together. 
Consider the situations when:
- your boss asks you what you're working on...
- or if you find yourself in an elevator with one of your stakeholders and want to give a quick rundown...
- or if your 30 minute agenda gets hijacked and you only have 10 or 5 minutes to convery the story...

### Big Idea
The Big Idea is even more granular as it summarizes your story down into a single sentence. The Big Idea has 3 components:
1. Articulates your point of view;
2. Conveys what's at stake; and
3. Is a complete sentence.

### Story Boarding 
This is a concept to help you create a specific strategy when it comes to planning content. It is ideal to get acceptance from your stakeholder at this step to ensure that you are indeed in line with what is needed.

Don't start with presentation software! This leads to a greater attachment to the work that you have done, even if it may not be great (sunk cost). Avoid this unnecessary attachment by starting low-tech on white-boards, post-it notes, or plain paper which can be easily discarded without feeling the same sense of loss.
