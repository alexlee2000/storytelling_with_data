# Lessons in Storytelling

## Horizontal Logic
This tactic ensures that your audience can understand the overarching story that you want to communicate by just reading the slide titles of each slide throughout your deck. For this to work well, you need to have action titles (not descriptive titles).

One strategy is to have an excecutive summary slide up front, with each bullet correspondending to a subsequeny slide title in that order.

## Vertical Logic
This tactice ensures that all the content on a given slide reinforces each other. So, the content reinforces the title and vice versa. The words reinforce the visual and vice versa. 

## Reverse Storyboarding
Another tactic to ensure that your story is clear is by taking the final communication and writing down the main points from each page. THe resulting list should ideally look like the storyboard or outline for the story that you want to tell and if it doesn't, then you know that there are things that you can add or remove to make it so. 

## A Fresh Perspective
This will help you see through your audience's lens. Ask a friend or colleague or someone who doesn't have any context at all to tell you what they pay attention to, what they think is important, and where do they have questions.
