# Think like a designer (part 2) - Accessibility
Design your visual such that it is usable by people of widely varying technical skills (and diverse abilities). A well designed data visualization is easy to interpret and understand. So, the onus is on you to make it so. Here are 2 strategies related to accessibility in communication with data:
1. Don't overcomplicate
2. Text is your friend

## Don't Overcomplicate
The more complicated it looks, the more time your audience perceives it will take to understand and the less likely they are to spend time to understand it. 

Here are some tipe to keep your visuals and communications from appearing overly complicated:
- Make it legible: Use a consistent, easy-to-read font (consider typeface and size)
- Keep it clean: Make your visualization approachable by leveraging visual affordances
- Use straightforward language:
  - Simple language >> Complex language
  - Fewer words >> More words
  - If defining specialized language with which your audience may not be familiar with, define it!
  - Spell out acronyms the first time they are used or place in a footnote.
- Remove unnecessary complexity: Simple >> Complex

This is not about oversimplifying, but rather not making things more complicated than they need to be. If it is too complicated, it will most likley annoy your audience if you are trying to sound smart. This might in turn make your audience feel dumb. Avoid this. Seek input from a friend or colleague for feedback.
