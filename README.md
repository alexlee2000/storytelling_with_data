# storytelling_with_data

This repo is intended to store my personal notes for **"Storytelling with data - Cole nussbaumer Knaflic"**. I highly recommend obtaining the book and reading it for yourself as these notes are just a summary of what I personally found interesting/important to me. I tried not to write my notes verbatim as much as I could, however you might find some sentences practically the same as what is in the book. Regardless, I hope that this summary can provide some quick tips for you if you find yourself in a time crunch. 

## Contents

  - Who is your audience? What do you want them to do? How will you communicate to them? What data do you have?

**Chapter 2 - choosing an effective visual**
  - Simple Text: To highlight a number or two
  - Line Charts: Good for continuous data

  - Evaluate effectiveness of preattentive attributes by applying the "where are your eyes drawn?" test.
