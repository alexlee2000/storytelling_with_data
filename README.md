# storytelling_with_data

This repo is intended to store my personal notes for **"Storytelling with data - Cole nussbaumer Knaflic"**. I highly recommend obtaining the book and reading it for yourself as these notes are just a summary of what I personally found interesting/important to me. I tried not to write my notes verbatim as much as I could, however you might find some sentences practically the same as what is in the book. Regardless, I hope that this summary can provide some quick tips for you if you find yourself in a time crunch. 

## Contents
**Chapter 1 - the importance of context**
  - Who is your audience? What do you want them to do? How will you communicate to them? What data do you have?
  - 3 minute story, big idea, storyboarding

**Chapter 2 - choosing an effective visual**
  - Simple Text: To highlight a number or two
  - Line Charts: Good for continuous data
  - Bar charts: Good for categorical data (must have a zero baseline)
  - Avoid Pies, donuts, 3D, and secondary y-axes due to difficulty of interpretation.

**Chapter 3 - clutter is your enemy!**
  - Move everything to the background first and identify clutter.
  - Leverage Gestalt Principles
  - Use contrast strategically
  - Employ alignment of elements and maintain whitespace to make your visuals more comfortable for your audience.

**Chapter 4 - focus your audience's attention**
  - Leverage Preattentive attributes like color, size, position to signal what's important
  - Evaluate effectiveness of preattentive attributes by applying the "where are your eyes drawn?" test.

**Chapter 5 - think like a designer**
  - Leverage visual affordances as cues for how to interact with your communication: highlight the important stuff, eliminate distractions, and create a visual hierarchy of information.
  - Use text to label and explain to make your design more accessible.
  - Increase your audience's tolerance of design issues by making your visuals aesthetically pleasing.
  - Work to gain audience acceptance of your visual designs.

**Chapter 6 - dissecting model visuals**
  - Good examples of linegraph + stacked graphs 

**Chapter 7 - lessons in storytelling**
  - Clear beginning (plot) --> Middle (twists) --> End (call to action).
  - Leverage conflict and tension to grab/maintain your audience's attention.
  - Horizontal logic: Do the slide titles tell the overarching story? Use action titles
  - Vertical logic: Does all the content on your page reinforce each other?
  - Reverse Storyboarding: Write down the main points of each page of your final pack. Does your reverse storyboard reflect your message?
  - A Fresh perspective: Ask feedback from someone who doesn't have any context.
