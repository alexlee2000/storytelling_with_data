## Storytelling with Data Pipeline
1. Understand the context
  - Who is your audience? What do you want them to do? How will you communicate to them? What data do you have?
  - 3 minute story, big idea, storyboarding
3. Choose an appropriate visual display
  - Simple Text: To highlight a number or two
  - Line Charts: Good for continuous data
  - Bar charts: Good for categorical data (must have a zero baseline)
  - Avoid Pies, donuts, 3D, and secondary y-axes due to difficulty of interpretation. 
3. Eliminate Clutter
  - Move everything to the background first and identify clutter.
  - Leverage Gestalt Principles
  - Use contrast strategically
  - Employ alignment of elements and maintain whitespace to make your visuals more comfortable for your audience.
4. Focus attention where you want it
  - Leverage Preattentive attributes like color, size, position to signal what's important
  - Evaluate effectiveness of preattentive attributes by applying the "where are your eyes drawn?" test. 
5. Think like a designer
  - Leverage visual affordances as cues for how to interact with your communication: highlight the important stuff, eliminate distractions, and create a visual hierarchy of information.
  - Use text to label and explain to make your design more accessible.
  - Increase your audience's tolerance of design issues by making your visuals aesthetically pleasing.
  - Work to gain audience acceptance of your visual designs.
6. Tell a story
  - Clear beginning (plot) --> Middle (twists) --> End (call to action).
  - Leverage conflict and tension to grab/maintain your audience's attention.
  - Use vertical/horizontal logic, reverse storyboarding to ensure your story comes across clearly in your communication.
