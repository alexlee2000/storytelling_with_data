# Clutter is your Enemy!

## Cognitive Load
- Every single element that you add to a blank page will take up some cognitive load on the audience.
- Every member of your audience has a finite amount of cognitive load (mental processing power) that they can take.
- There is also a perceived cognitive load: how hard they believe they are going to have to work to get the information out of your communication. If the perceived cognitive load is too high, you risk your audience deciding that they don't want to take the time and processsing power to understand what you're showing. Think about lectures and super cluttered slides.
- Identify anything that isn't adding enough informative value to make up for its presence - and remove those things. 

### 1. Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception
When it comes to identifying which elements in our visuals are signal (useful info), and which are noise (clutter), consider the 6 Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception.

#### 1.1. Proximity
When we see objects that are physically close in proximity, we automatically assume that they belong to a specific grouping.

Here, we see columns and rows, simply due to the dot spacing.

#### 1.2. Similarity
Objects of similar colour, shape, size, or orientation are perceived as belonging to a particular group.

We can use this to help draw our audience's eyes in the direction we want them to focus on.

#### 1.3. Enclosure
Objects that are physically enclosed together suggest that they belong to a particular group.

We can use this to draw visual distinctions within data.

#### 1.4. Closure
When people see a visual, they like to see it as something that they have already seen before. So, people tend to perceive a set of indivudal elements as a single, recognizable, familiar shape/construct. The elements in the figure below will tend to be perceived as a circle first and as individual elements afterwards.

Graphing applications like Excel will commonly have default settings to include elements like chart borders, and background shading. The closure principle tells us that these are unnecessary, and that we can remove them from the graph - making the graph still appear as a cohesive entity.

#### 1.5. Continuity
When looking at objects, our eyes seek the smoothest path and naturally create continuity in what we see even if it isn't explicitly shown. 

Although we removed the vertical y-axis line from a graph, your eyes can still see that the bars are lined up at the same point because of the consistent white space between the labels and data. This provides another way we can strip away unnecessary elements, allowing the data to stand out even more.

#### 1.6. Connection
We tend to think of objects that are physically connected as part of a group. The connective property typically has a stronger associative priority than similar color, shape or size. When looking at the figure below, your eyes will generally pair the shapes connected by the lines rather than similar color, shape or size. However, note that the connective property isn't typically stronger than enclosure (but this can be impacted through thickness and darkness of lines to create your desired hierarchy).

One way that this principle is applied is in line graphs, to help our eyes see the order in the data.
