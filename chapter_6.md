# Dissecting model visuals (Some good examples)
For each of these visuals, consider the design choices that were intentionally made;
1. Choice of graph type and ordering of data.
2. Where our eyes are drawn and in what order due to strategies employed to emphasize and de-emphasize components through the use of color, thickness, and size.
3. Alignment and positioning of elements.
4. Appropriate use of text that makes visuals accessible through clear titling, labelling, and annotation.
