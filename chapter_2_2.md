# Graphs

## 4. Points/Scatterplot
**Usecase** 

Used for showing the relationship between two things. 

**Example**

## 5. Lines/Line_Graph
**Usecase** 

Used for plotting continuous data, often in some unit of time: days, months, quarters, or years. Line graphs can be used to show single or multiple series of data. 

**Tip**

When you're graphing time on the x-axis of a line graph, make sure that the data plotted are in consistent intervals. 


## 6. Lines/Slope_Graph
**Usecase** 

Used when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly show the relative increases/decreases or differences across various attributes between two data points. Slopegraphs give you the absolute values (the points) + the visual increase or decrease in rate of change (slope direction).

**Tip**

If many of the lines are overlapping, then a slopegraph may not work in this case. However, if you're just trying to emphasize a single series, then it could work by drawing attention to that single category that increased or decreased over time.

**Example**

## 7. Bars
**Usecase** 

Bar charts are often avoided because they are so common. Since it is so common, you should actually use it more as your audience will already be familiar with the graph. They can their brain power to focus on what the key message is in a common bar chart rather than waste capacity trying to figure out how to read a complex graph.

**Tip**

- Bar charts must have a 'zero' baseline to ensure that we get the correct visual increase/decrease. If the bar chart starts above zero, then the visual increase is grossly misrepresented. Therefore, show the entire bar to give context to make an accurate comparison for the viewer.
- In general, the bar width should be wider than ther white space between the bars, but also not so wide to the point where your audience compares areas instead of lengths.

## 8. Bars/Vertical_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Also known as a column chart, this can be used for single/multiple series. 

**Tip**

The more series of data that you add, the more difficult it is to focus on a single bar at a time to pull out insight. So, use multiple series bar charts with caution. 

**Example**

## 9. Bars/Stacked_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Allows you to compare totals across categories and also seeing the subcomponent pieces within a given category. This can quickly become visually overwhelming. Also, it is hard to compare the subcomponents across the various categories once you go beyond the bottom series, as you no longer have a consistent baseline to use for reference. 

**Tip**

Put the most important subcateogy on the bottom and highlight it for visual ease.

**Example**

## 10. Bars/Waterfall_chart
**Usecase**

Used to pull apart the separarte sections of a stacked bar chart to highlight the incremental changes from the starting point to the end point.

**Tip**

If your graphing application doesn't have this chart funcionaltiy built in, you can create one leveraging the stacked bar chart and making some series invisible. 

**Example**

## 11. Bars/Horizontal_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Best for categorical data as it makes the category labels a lot easier to read especially when your category names are long. We generally process information starting at the top left and making Z's with our eyes across the page. The horizaontal bar chart means that your audience will read the category names before the actual data which will ensure that they already know what the data represents instead of darting back and forth with vertical bar charts. 

**Tip**

Be mindful about how your categories are ordered. If there is already a natural ordering to your categories (e.g. age groups), then leverage that existing order. Your audience will look at your visual starting at the top left and then zigzagging, so they will encounter the top of your graph first. If the biggest category is the most the important, then consider putting that first and ordering the rest in decreasing numerical order. Or if the smallest category is the most important, then put that at the top and order by ascending data values instead.

## 12. Bars/Stacked_horizontal_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Similar to stacked vertical bar chart - can be used to show the totals/percentages across different categories and also give a sense of the subcomponent pieces.

**Example**

## 13. Area
**Usecase**

Humans eye's don't do a great job attributing quantitative values to 2D space which makes Area graphs harder to read than others. However, these become useful when you need ot visualize numbers of vastly different magnitudes. 

**Example**
