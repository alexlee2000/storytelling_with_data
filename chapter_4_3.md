# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 3) - Graphs

### Preattentive Attributes in Graphs - Example 1
Consider the example below...

This graph has no visual cues. So, you are left to process all of the information as you aren't given cues as to what's important or should be paid attention to. Consider the modified graph below with some preattentive attributes...

Now, let's go a step further using the same visual but modifying the focus from macro to micro parts of the story...

Repeated iterations of the same visual, with different pieces emphasized to tell different stories or different aspects of the same story (as demonstrated in the 3 figures above), can be an effective strategy. This will allow you to familiarize your audience with your data and visual first, and then continue to leverager it in the manner illustrated. 

### Preattentive Attributes in Graphs - Example 2
A good strategy is to start by pushing everything to the background. This forces you to make explicit decisions regarding what to bring to the forefront or highlight. 

Next, you generally want to make the data stand out by using color in the data series, and the labels bolder and bigger than the axis lines and labels. 

WE can add data markers and numeric labels to every data point initially. This will quickly create a cluttered mess...

But, if we're strategic about which data markers and labels we preserve and which we eliminate, we get a much cleaner chart. The added marks act as a "look here" signal, drawing our audience's attention more quickly to the right side of the graph. They provide the added benefit of allowing your audience to do some quick math in the event that they want to understand how big the backlog is becoming (consider doing this if it is something that your audience would definitely want to do).
