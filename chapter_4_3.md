### Preattentive Attributes in Graphs
Consider the example below...

This graph has no visual cues. So, you are left to process all of the information as you aren't given cues as to what's important or should be paid attention to. Consider the modified graph below with some preattentive attributes...

Repeated iterations of the same visual, with different pieces emphasized to tell different stories or different aspects of the same story (as demonstrated in the 3 figures above), can be an effective strategy. This will allow you to familiarize your audience with your data and visual first, and then continue to leverager it in the manner illustrated.
