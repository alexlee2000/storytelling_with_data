# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 2) - Text

### Preattentive Attributes in Text
Without any visual cues, when we are confronted with a block of text, we have no choice but to read all of itl, put on the lens of what's important or interesting, then possible read it again to put the interesting parts into context. 

Now consider leveraging preattentive attributes to change the way you process the information. Each block of text employs a single preattentiev attribute each. Note how within each, the preattentive attribute grabs your attentions with varying levels of force (e.g. color/size are attention grabbing, whereas italics achieve a milder emphasis).

We can leverage preattentive attributes to create a clear visual hierarchy of information that established implicit instructions for your audience. indicating to them in what order they should process information.
