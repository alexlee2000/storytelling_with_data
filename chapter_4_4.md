# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 4) - Size, Color, Positioning

Here is an easy test to determine whether preattentive attributes are being used effectively
1. Create your visual
2. Close your eyes or look away for a moment and then look back at it.
3. Take note of where your eyes are drawn first (i.e. are they immediately drawn to where you want your audience to focus?)
4. Ask a friend/colleague to talk you through how they process the visual: where their eyes go first, where they go next, and so on...

## Size
- Relative size denotes relative importance.
- Your design choices should be the result of explicit decisions.
- Use size to indicate importance and/or similarity.

## Color
- Don't use color for the sake of being colorful; instead, use it intentionally. It is a good idea to use shades of grey in your visuals and pick a single bold color to draw attention where you want it. The base color is grey, not black, to allow for greater contrast. Blue is a good color to use as you avoid issues of colorblindess and it prints well in black-and-white.
- When it comes to the use of color
  - Use it sparingly,
    - For color to be effective, it must be used sparingly (It is easy to spot a hawk in a flock of birds, but it is harder in a variety of birds).
    - There needs to be sufficient contrast to make something draw your audiences attention.
    - Don't go rainbow mode and use every color in the rainbow. Everything is different, and so nothing stands out. Instead, use varying ciolor saturations of a single color (a heatmap)
  - Use it consistently,
  - Design with the colorblind in mind,
  - Be thoughtful of the tone color conveys,
  - consider whether to leverage brand colors.
