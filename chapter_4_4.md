# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 4) - Size, Color, Positioning

Here is an easy test to determine whether preattentive attributes are being used effectively
1. Create your visual
2. Close your eyes or look away for a moment and then look back at it.
3. Take note of where your eyes are drawn first (i.e. are they immediately drawn to where you want your audience to focus?)
4. Ask a friend/colleague to talk you through how they process the visual: where their eyes go first, where they go next, and so on...

## Size
- Relative size denotes relative importance.
- Your design choices should be the result of explicit decisions.
- Use size to indicate importance and/or similarity.

## Color
- Don't use color for the sake of being colorful; instead, use it intentionally. It is a good idea to use shades of grey in your visuals and pick a single bold color to draw attention where you want it. The base color is grey, not black, to allow for greater contrast. Blue is a good color to use as you avoid issues of colorblindess and it prints well in black-and-white.

When it comes to the use of color
- Use it **SPARINGLY**,
  - For color to be effective, it must be used sparingly (It is easy to spot a hawk in a flock of birds, but it is harder in a variety of birds).
  - There needs to be sufficient contrast to make something draw your audiences attention.
  - Don't go rainbow mode and use every color in the rainbow. Everything is different, and so nothing stands out. Instead, use varying ciolor saturations of a single color (a heatmap)
- Use it **CONSISTENTLY**,
  - When it comes to the type of graph or color, you should always use whatever will be easiest for your audience to read. When showing similar information that can be graphed the same way, there can be benefit to keeping the same layout as you train your audience how to read the information, which will make interpretation of the later graphs easier, reducing mental fatigue.
  - A change in color signals a change. Don't use color for novelty.
  - Don't confuse your audience by changing your use of color. Preserve the chosen color schematic throughout the visuals in your presentation. 
- Design with the **COLORBLIND** in mind,
  - Roughly 8% of mean and 0.5% of women are colorblind. This generally presents difficulty in distinguishing between shades of red and shades of green. In general, avoid using shades of red and shades of green together. However, green and red can be useful colors to use to show profit/loss. In these cases, we can use them, but consider also adding in some other visual cues on top of this (a plus/minus sign, vary saturation or brightness, boldness of text) so that we don't inadvertently exclude part of your audience.
  - Or, you could just use blue to signal a positive and orange to signal a negative to avoid this colorblind challenge altogether. Or also consider if you even need to highlight both. It might be better to draw attention to one or the other. 
- Be thoughtful of the **TONE** color conveys,
  - Color evokes emotion. So, consider the tone that you want to set with your data visualization.
    - Is the topic serious or lighthearted?
    - Are you making a striking bold statement and do you want your colors to echo it?
- consider whether to leverage **BRAND** colors.
  - There may be brand colors that you are required to work with or that make sense to leverage. In this case, identify one or two brand-appropriate colors to use as your "audience-look-here" cues and keep the rest of your color palette relatively muted with shades of grey or black.
  - In some cases, it may make sense to deviate from brand colors entirely. For example, if your client had a brand color that is a lighter shade, it may simply not be attention grabbing enouigh due to the lack of contrastt. In this case, you can use bold black to draw attention when everything else is in shades of grey, or choose an entirely different color so long as it doesn't clash with the logo if it is on the same page. 

## Position on Page
- Without other visual cues, most members of your audience will start at the top left of your visual and slide/scan with their eyes in a zig-zag motion across the screen or page.
- If something is important, put it at the top. On a slide, these may be words (the main takeaway or call to action). In a data visualization, think about which data you want your audience to see first and whether rearranging your visual accordingly makes sense (it won't always, but this is a tool you can use where possible).
- Be mindful of how you position elements on a page and aim to do so in a way that will feel natural for your audience to consume.
