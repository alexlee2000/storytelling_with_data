# The Importance of Context

## Exploratory vs Explanatory analysis
1. Exploratory: Understanding the data and identifying interesting points to highlight to others. (May require many iterations/hypothesis)
2. Explanatory: Communicating the exploratory analysis to the audience by having a specific story.

Often, we mistakenly focus on showing the exploratory analysis as evidence of the work you did and the robustness of the analysis. Resist this urge and instead, concentrate on the information that your audience needs to know. 

## Who, what, and How
Consider, 
1. To **whom** are you communicating? (_Who is your audience and how do they perceive you?_)
2. **What** do you want your audience to know or do? (_How do you want your audience to act? What tone will you use?_)
3. **How** can you use data to help make your point?

### 1. Who
#### (is) Your audience 
- The more specific, the better. Avoid general audiences and identify the decision maker to narrow your audience.
- If you try to communicate to too many people with different needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you cannot communicate to anyone as effectively as you could if you narrowed your audience. This would result in creating many different commmunications for different audiences.
