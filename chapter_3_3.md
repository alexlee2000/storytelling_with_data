# Clutter is your Enemy! (part 3) - Decluttering Step by Step
Here is the original graph. Let's declutter together using the Gestalt Principles, Alignment, White Space, and Contrast!

### 1. Remove Chart Border
The Gestalt Principle of Closure suggests that chart borders are usually unnecessary. Instead, use white space to differentiate the visual from other elements on the page. 

### 2. Remove Grid Lines
If you think that having gridlines will help your data be more effectively processed, then keep the gridlines, but make them thin and use a lighter color like grey. It shouldn't be competing visually with your data. However, when you can, you should get rid of them altogether which allows for greater contrast, making your data stand out more. 

### 3. Remove Data Markers
Every single element adds cognitive load on the part of your audience. Having data markers will add cognitive load to process data that is already depicted visually with the lines. However, this isn't to say to never use data markers, but rather to only use them with purpose and not because it is your graphing application's default setting. 

### 4. Clean up Axis Labels
The trailing zeros on the y-axis have no informative value and make the numbers look more complicated than they are. This is unnecessary burden on the audience's cognitive load. We can also abbreviate the months of the year so that they will fit horizontally on the x-axis, eliminating the diagonal text. 

### 5. Label Data Directly
We want to try identify anything that will feel like effort to our audience and integrate it into the design to make it as easy to understand as possible. The work of going back and forth between the legend and the data is again unnecessary cognitive load. Let's instead use the Gestalt Principle of Proximity and put the data labels right next to the data they describe.

### 6. Leverage Consistent Color
Although we leveragse the Gestalt Principle of Proximity in the previous step, let's also implement the Gestalt Principle of Similarity and make the data labesl the same color as the data they describe. This is another visual cue to our audience that says "these two pieces of information are related". 

# Before and After...
Although the visual is not yet complete, we have improved it dramatically just by decluttering.

## Conclusion
- Any information you put in front of your audience creates cognitive load on their brain.
- Visual clutter creates excessive cognitive load which can hinder the transmission of the message.
- The Gestalt Principles of Perception help us understand how your audience sees and allows you to identify and remove clutter.
- Leverage alignment of elements and maintain white space to help make the experience of reading your visuals as comfortable for your audience as you can.
- Use contrast strategically.
- Clutter is your enemy!
