# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 4) - Size, Color, Positioning

Here is an easy test to determine whether preattentive attributes are being used effectively
1. Create your visual
2. Close your eyes or look away for a moment and then look back at it.
3. Take note of where your eyes are drawn first (i.e. are they immediately drawn to where you want your audience to focus?)
4. Ask a friend/colleague to talk you through how they process the visual: where their eyes go first, where they go next, and so on...

## Size
- Relative size denotes relative importance.
- Your design choices should be the result of explicit decisions.
- Use size to indicate importance and/or similarity.
