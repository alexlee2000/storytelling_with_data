# Think like a designer (part 1) - Affordances
- Form (visual) follows Function (what we want our audience to be able to do with the data).
- Affordances: Aspectes inherent to the design that make it obvious how the produce it to be used. E.g. A knob affords turning, A button affords pushing, a cord affords pulling etc...
- We can leverage visual affordances to indicate to our audience how to use and interact with our visualizations. We'll discuss 3 specific lessons:
  1. Highlight the important stuff
  2. Eliminate distractions
  3. Create a clear hierarchy of information
 
## 1. Highlight the Important Stuff
- It is recommended that at most, 10% of the visual design be highlighted. Here are some guidelines:
  - Bold, italics and underlining
    - Use for titles, labels, captions and short word sequences to differentiate elements.
    - Bold is preferred as it adds minimal noise whilst clearly highlighting chosen elements. Italics add minimal noise, but also don't stand out as much and are less legible. And underlining adds noise and compromises legibility to should bne used sparingly (if at all).
  - CASE and typeface
    - Uppercase works well for titles, labels and keywords (i.e. short word sequences).
    - Avoid using different fonts as a highlighting technique as it is difficult to attain a noticeable difference without disrupting aesthetics.
  - Color
    - Effective when used sparingly and generally in concert with other highlighting techniques (e.g. Bold)
  - Inversing elements
    - Effective at attracting attention but can add considerable noise to a design so should be used sparingly.
  - Size
    - Another way to attract attention and signal importance
  - Avoid using Blinking or Flashing for explanatory purposes as it tends to be more annoying than helpful. Unless, it is highly critical information that requires immediate response.

  Note that preattentive attributes can be layered (i.e. Bold + Large size + colored).

## 2. Eliminate Distractions
- "You know you have achieved perfrection, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing to take away"
- Think about both clutter (elements that take up space but don't add information) and context (what needs to be present in order for you audience to understand the communication)
- Here are some specific considerations to help you identify potential distractions:
  - Not all data are equally important: Get rid of noncritical data/componenets.
  - When detail isn't needed, summarize: You should be familiar with the detail, but that doesn't mean that your audience needs to be. Consider whether summarizing is appropriate.
  - Ask yourself: Would eliminating this change anything?: No? Take it out! If it doesn't support the message, it doesn't serve the purpose of the communication.
  - Push necessary, but non-message-impacting items to the back-ground: 

### Before and After

- Line graphs typically make it easier to see trends over time. THis also viisually reduces discrete elements from 25 bars to 4 lines.
- Removed the "All" category as in this case it didn't really add any value
- Decimal points were eliminated by rounding to nearest whole digit. Consider how its strange to have the number of adults using decimal places (how can you have a fraction of a person?!)
- Italics in subtitle were changes to regular font as there was no reason to draw attention to these words. Also, the spatial separataion between the title and subtitle caused undue attention to be placed on the subtitle, so this was removed.
- The highlighting of the "Bachelor's Degree or more" category was preserved and extended to include the category name in addition to the data labels.
