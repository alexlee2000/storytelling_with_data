# Think like a designer (part 1) - Affordances
- Form (visual) follows Function (what we want our audience to be able to do with the data).
- Affordances: Aspectes inherent to the design that make it obvious how the produce it to be used. E.g. A knob affords turning, A button affords pushing, a cord affords pulling etc...

  1. Highlight the important stuff
  2. Eliminate distractions
  3. Create a clear hierarchy of information
