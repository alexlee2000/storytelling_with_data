# Clutter is your Enemy! (part 2) - Other Types of Visual Clutter
- Note that some seemingly redundant details aren't actually clutter. There are some elements that should always be retained with numbers, including dollar/percent signs, and commas in large numbers. 

## Lack of Visual Order

### Alignment
- Center-aligned text does not create clean lines either on the left or on the right. So, try to avoid this as it makes the layout appear sloppy.
- Instead, use left-jusitified or right-justified text in order to create clean linse (both horizonatally and vertically) of elements and white space.
- Since your audience will typically start at the top left of the page and move their eyes in a "z" shape, when it comes to tables and graphs, it is usually best to upper-left-most justify the text (title, axis titles, legend) to ensure that your audience knows what the table is about before even hitting the data itself.
- Generally, avoid using diagonal elements such as lines or text. "The reading of rotated text 45 degrees in either direction was on average 52% slower than reading normally oriented text (text rotated 90 degrees in either direction was 205% slower on average). 

### White Space
- Get more comfortable with whitespace. Don't add data without a thoughftul and specific purpose in mind.
- Whitespace can be used to strategically draw attention and emphasis to the important parts of your visual.
- Here are some guidelines to utilizing whitespace:
  - Margins should remain free of text and visuals
  - Resist the urge to stretch a visual to take up the available space. Instead, appropriately size your visual to the content

## Non-Strategic Use of Contrast
- Clear contrast signals to our audience where to focus their attention.
- Consider this analogy. It is easy to spot a hawk in a sky full of pigeons, but it becomes a lot harder to pick out the same hawk if the variety of birds increase. I.e. The more thing we make different, the lesser the degree tow hich any of them stand out.
- So if we want something really important to stand out to the audience, the nwe should make that the one thing that is different from the rest.

- Horizontal bar chart to depict information
- Rescaled numbers to be on a positive scale (the original scatterplot had negative values that complicated the visualization)
- Since we are more interested in the relative differences than absolute values, it is fine to rescale like so.
- Categories now run down the vertical y axis (was on the x-axis before)
- The decision not to show x-axis scale is deliberate. THis forces the audiecne to focu on relative differenes rather than the specific values.
- Competitors are distinguished based on the order in which they appear (Comp A is alwayus after blue bar, followed by comp B, comp C, etc...) which is outlined in the legend itself. However, note that this makes it a bit more difficult to quickly identify each specific competitor.
- Added in a summary metric (relative rank)
