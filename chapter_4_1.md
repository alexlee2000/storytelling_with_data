# Focus your Audience's Attention (part 1) - Memory

## Memory
There are 3 types of memory within the brain that are important to understand when we design visual communications:
1. Iconic Memory
2. Short-term Memory
3. Long-term Memory

### 1. Iconic Memory
- Fast and happens wit hout you consciously realizing it.
- The ability to quickly pick up differences in our environment. This was an evolutionary feature due to the need to identify movement of predators in the distance long ago.
- Information stays in your iconic memory for a fraction of a second before it gets forwarded on to your short-term memory.
- Your iconic memory is tuned to a set of preattentitve attributes. 

### 2. Short-term Memory
- People can only keep about four chunks of visual information in their short-term memory at a given time. So, if we create a graph with ten different data series, with ten different colors, shapes, data markers, and a legend off to the side, we are making our audience work very hard going back and forth between the legend and the data to decipher what they are looking at. We want to reduce cognitive load.
- A solution in this case would be to label the various data series directly (reducing the work of going back and forth to a legend).
- A more general solution is to create larger, coherent chunks of information so that we can fit them into the finite space in our audience's working memory. 

### 3. Long-term Memory
- When something leaves short-term memory, it will either evaporate, or it will pass into long-term memory. This is built up over a lifetime and is important for pattern recognition and general cognitive processing.
- Long-term memory is the aggregate of visual and verbal memory. Verbal is accessed by a neural net and visual is accessed with other specialized structures.

## Preattentive Attributes
Studies show that we have about 3-8 seconds with our audience, during which time they decide whether to continue to look at what we've put in front of them or direct attention to something else. If we use the preattentive attribbuted wisely, then 3-8 seconds is enough time to give our audience the gist of what we want to say with our visual.

Note that your eyes are drawn to the one element within each group that is different from the rest: YOu don't have to look for it. That's because our brains are hardwired to quickly pick up differences we see in our environment. If we use preattentiev attributes strategically, we can enable our audience to see what we want them to see before they even know they're seeing it. 


### Preattentive Attributes in Graphs
Consider the example below...

This graph has no visual cues. So, you are left to process all of the information as you aren't given cues as to what's important or should be paid attention to. Consider the modified graph below with some preattentive attributes...

Now, let's go a step further using the same visual but modifying the focus from macro to micro parts of the story...

Repeated iterations of the same visual, with different pieces emphasized to tell different stories or different aspects of the same story (as demonstrated in the 3 figures above), can be an effective strategy. This will allow you to familiarize your audience with your data and visual first, and then continue to leverager it in the manner illustrated.
