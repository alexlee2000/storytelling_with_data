# Choosing an Effective Visual (part 1) - Simple Text & Tables
## 1. Simple Text 
**Usecase**

If you need to share just 1 or 2 numbers/percentages.

**Tip** 

Make the number as prominent as possible with a few supporting words to clearly make your point, providing some more oomph! The secondary number can be placed into the supporting words so as to not lose context.

**Example**

## 2. Tables
**Usecase** 

Communicating to a mixed audience who will each be looking for their particular row/col of interest.

**Tip** 

A table is often not the best idea to use in a live presentation as you lose your audience's ears and attention momentaraily. Consider putting it in the appendix and linking it for reference. You want to keep in mind that the design should fade into the background, letting the data take center stage (i.e. don't let heavy borders or shading compete for attention of the data). 

**Example**

## 3. Heatmap
**Usecase** 

A special case of tables that helps to reduce mental processing of the audience and helps them to more quickly target the potential points of interest. 

**Tip**

Excel has this functionality with conditional formatting. Just make sure that when using color saturation, your are always including a legend to help the reader interpet the data.
