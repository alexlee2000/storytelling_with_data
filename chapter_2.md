# Choosing an Effective Visual
## 1. Simple Text 
**Usecase**

If you need to share just 1 or 2 numbers/percentages.

**Tip** 

Make the number as prominent as possible with a few supporting words to clearly make your point, providing some more oomph! The secondary number can be placed into the supporting words so as to not lose context.

**Example**

## 2. Tables
**Usecase** 

Communicating to a mixed audience who will each be looking for their particular row/col of interest.

**Tip** 

A table is often not the best idea to use in a live presentation as you lose your audience's ears and attention momentaraily. Consider putting it in the appendix and linking it for reference. You want to keep in mind that the design should fade into the background, letting the data take center stage (i.e. don't let heavy borders or shading compete for attention of the data). 

**Example**

## 3. Heatmap
**Usecase** 

A special case of tables that helps to reduce mental processing of the audience and helps them to more quickly target the potential points of interest. 

**Tip**

Excel has this functionality with conditional formatting. Just make sure that when using color saturation, your are always including a legend to help the reader interpet the data.

**Example**

## 4. Graphs/Points/Scatterplot
**Usecase** 

Used for showing the relationship between two things. 

**Example**

## 5. Graphs/Lines/Line_Graph
**Usecase** 

Used for plotting continuous data, often in some unit of time: days, months, quarters, or years. Line graphs can be used to show single or multiple series of data. 

**Tip**

When you're graphing time on the x-axis of a line graph, make sure that the data plotted are in consistent intervals. 


## 6. Graphs/Lines/Slope_Graph
**Usecase** 

Used when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly show the relative increases/decreases or differences across various attributes between two data points. Slopegraphs give you the absolute values (the points) + the visual increase or decrease in rate of change (slope direction).

**Tip**

If many of the lines are overlapping, then a slopegraph may not work in this case. However, if you're just trying to emphasize a single series, then it could work by drawing attention to that single category that increased or decreased over time.

**Example**

## 7. Graphs/Bars
**Usecase** 

Bar charts are often avoided because they are so common. Since it is so common, you should actually use it more as your audience will already be familiar with the graph. They can their brain power to focus on what the key message is in a common bar chart rather than waste capacity trying to figure out how to read a complex graph.

**Tip**

- Bar charts must have a 'zero' baseline to ensure that we get the correct visual increase/decrease. If the bar chart starts above zero, then the visual increase is grossly misrepresented. Therefore, show the entire bar to give context to make an accurate comparison for the viewer.
- In general, the bar width should be wider than ther white space between the bars, but also not so wide to the point where your audience compares areas instead of lengths.

## 8. Graphs/Bars/Vertical_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Also known as a column chart, this can be used for single/multiple series. 

**Tip**

The more series of data that you add, the more difficult it is to focus on a single bar at a time to pull out insight. So, use multiple series bar charts with caution. 

**Example**

## 9. Graphs/Bars/Stacked_bar_chart
**Usecase**

Allows you to compare totals across categories and also seeing the subcomponent pieces within a given category. This can quickly become visually overwhelming. Also, it is hard to compare the subcomponents across the various categories once you go beyond the bottom series, as you no longer have a consistent baseline to use for reference. 

**Tip**

Put the most important subcateogy on the bottom and highlight it for visual ease.

**Example**
